Entry for The Stamford Hackathon, Stamford CT 20 Feb 2016

### The Idea
The idea is to make micro-social networks for building-sized co-located communities, and include the building as both a persona and participant.  Any posts made in the building are automatically aggregated to the building's account and then automatically routed to the correct location or individual in the building (e.g. facilities management, building event coordinators, etc.) and some (most) are also available to all the network members (while in the building).

### How It Was Built
This application was built with the Ionic Framework (Angular.js/JavaScript) and uses the Google FireBase service for authentication and cloud data storage.

### Live Web App

The live web app can be found here:  [http://capricious-stream.surge.sh](http://capricious-stream.surge.sh)

Currently the building is hard-coded to the **Stamford Innovation Center** building 

(175 Atlantic Street Stamford, CT 06901 - [View Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/175+Atlantic+St,+Stamford,+CT+06901/@41.0529486,-73.5420202,17z/)).

Please contact me directly if you wish to use this application for your building.
